## How does this wordle solver work?

This wordle solver uses the information provided from each guess to narrow down the remaining list of 5-letter english words that could be the solution. From there, the wordle solver determines the most likely words (i.e. the best words to guess next). It does this using a combination of word frequencies (provided by `wordfreq`) and the expected number of words remaining if guessed (which wordle solver aims to minimize).
